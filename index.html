							<h2>Visit SWS</h2>
							<p>SWS offers two kinds of consultations: face-to-face (by appointment and walk-in) and online.A writing consultation is a 40-minute conversation between a writer and a consultant.  <br> <br> Consultants work with writers at any stage of the writerâ€™s process, such as brainstorming and organizing ideas, developing a thesis statement or line of argument, creating cohesive paragraphs, revising sentences, and documenting sources. A consultation is often focused on a specific assignment or writing task, with the goal of supporting you as you develop more effective and productive writing strategies to apply to future writing projects.<br> <br> In a consultation, you will work together with the consultant to set the agenda for the session based on your goals and concerns, then read and discuss the work in progress and collaborate to reach your goals.</p>
