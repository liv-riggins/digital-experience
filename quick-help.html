   <p><a href="http://www.lib.umn.edu/help/disscalc/" target="_blank">Dissertation Calculator</a><br />
   This online tool from the University of Minnesota helps students navigate the process   of writing a dissertation. The Dissertation Calculator breaks down the process into manageable stages with suggested deadlines, and provides students with important resources and advice   tailored to the University context. (This tool was created by the Center for Writing in partnership   with the University Libraries, the Center for Teaching and Learning Services, and   the Center for Research on Developmental Education and Urban Literacy.)</p>

   <p><a href="http://www.learnerassociates.net/dissthes/" target="_blank">Writing and Presenting Your Thesis Or Dissertation</a><br />
   This comprehensive guide from Michigan State’s Dr. S. Joseph Levine offers both practical and comforting advice to make the process of writing a dissertation—from preparing to write the proposal to writing the dissertation itself to handling the defense—more manageable, and even (on one’s best days) exciting.</p>
   <p><a href="http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/chinneck/thesis.html" target="_blank">How to Organize Your Thesis</a><br />
   This advice from Carleton University (Ottawa) computer science professor John W. Chinneck is widely generalizable across the disciplines. Not only does Chinneck offer a clear basic outline for a dissertation, but he helps writers conceptualize the project of a dissertation in the first place (see section entitled “What Graduate Research Is All About”).   </p>
