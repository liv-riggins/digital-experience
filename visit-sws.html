<h1 id="web">SWS.online Appointments</h1>
<p>Like our face-to-face consultations, online appointments are collaborative, student-centered conversations about writing. Unlike appointments in Nicholson, where consultants read and discuss your paper when you arrive, SWS.online consultations involve three parts: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>In <a href="../../../mysws">mySWS</a>, you will <strong>make an appointment</strong> for an online chat and will <strong>provide your writing and your specific questions</strong>. </li>
                  <li>Ninety minutes before  your online chat,<strong> a writing consultant  will read and respond to your document</strong>. By 45 minutes before your online chat, <strong>you will be able to read the comments</strong> on <a href="../../../mysws" target="_blank">mySWS</a>.</li>
                  <li><strong>You and the consultant will discuss your document in a 40-minute online chat</strong>.  In this collaborative online conversation, you and the consultant can address your questions and concerns, talk through revisions, and strategize about what to do next.</li>
                </ol>
								<p><a href=#online-detail>See below </a> for more information on
									 how to enter the SWS.online appointment and what to expect from it.</p>
<h2 id="online-detail">Using SWS.online</h2>
				<h3>What you’ll need for making your online consultation appointment</h3>
					                <ul>
					                  <li>your class and work calendar for scheduling the online chat</li>
					                  <li>a digital version of your document</li>
					                  <li>materials you can use to help the consultant understand the context of your writing project and focus on your questions and concerns:  the assignment sheet, the syllabus,  in-class notes,  previous drafts or feedback on your writing, etc.</li>
					                  <li>your specific questions and concerns for the consultant to focus on</li>
					                </ul>
					                <h3>What to expect after you’ve provided your document and questions</h4>
					                <ul>
					                  <li>About 45 minutes before your chat time, you will receive an email stating that your consultant has read and responded to your document and questions.
					                  This email will contain a link to your <a href="https://c4w.cla.umn.edu/sws/index.php?page=MySWS_Visits">Access My Visits</a> page, where you can read the consultant's comments.
														</li>
					                  <li>At your scheduled chat time, you will enter the chat from your <a href="https://c4w.cla.umn.edu/sws/index.php?page=MySWS_Visits">Access My Visits</a> page.
					                  Online chats last about 40 minutes.</li>
					                  <li>When the chat has ended, you will be able to read, download, and print a transcript of the chat and a read-only version of the document when the chat was completed. You will also own the editable Google document, which you will be able to access through your<a href="https://c4w.cla.umn.edu/sws/index.php?page=MySWS_Visits"> Access My Visits</a> page and through your Google Drive.</li>
					                  <li>The consultant’s goal is to help you develop writing strategies to apply to this particular paper/project and future work.</li>
					                </ul>
					                <h3>How to get helpful consultant comments</h3>
					                <ul>
					                  <li>Provide context for the document&#8212;explain the assignment, and if you include only part of a long paper, explain what comes before and after the part you include.</li>
					                  <li>Be specific about what you want the consultant to focus on. If you don't, they may tell you what you already know or focus on something you don't care about.</li>
					                  <li>Remember that the consultant will have 40 minutes to read and comment on your document.</li>
					                </ul>
					                <h3>How to take full advantage of the online chat</h3>
					                <ul>
					                  <li>If possible, read the consultant's comments and begin revising the paper before the chat. Note what consultant comments you want to discuss.</li>
					                  <li>If you need time to finish reading the consultant's comments during the chat, tell the consultant, who will wait until you have read them.</li>
					                  <li>During the chat, both you and the consultant can write on the document. You can make revisions and the consultant can comment on them.</li>
					                  <li>Ask the consultant for clarification of any comments you don't understand.</li>
					                  <li>Discuss your ideas during your online chat&#8212;you may be able to use your explanations in the paper itself. </li>
					                  <li>We discourage the use of a smartphone for the online chat; writers often experience technical issues when doing so. </li>
					                </ul>

	<div class="box">
	<h3> Having Technical Difficulties?</h3>
		<p>Check the following common tech issues:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Are you on a brower other than Google Chrome?</strong> SWS.online will work best in Google Chrome and will
			not work with Internet Explorer.</li>
			<li><strong>Have you blocked pop-ups?</strong> If you have prevented browser
			 dialog boxes or pop-ups from showing up, mySWS and SWS.online
		 will not work correctly.</li>
		 <li><strong>Are you logged into a different email account?</strong> To use SWS.online, you must be
		using your University of Minnesota–Twin Cities gmail.umn.edu account.
		Gopher Mail and non-UMN gmail accounts will not work.</li>
